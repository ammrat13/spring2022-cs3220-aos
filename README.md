# Hardware Implementation of Qarma

This code is primarily targeted to our final project for CS 3220 A: Processor
Design in Spring 2022 with [Dr. Hyesoon Kim][1]. Siddhant and I worked with
Yonghae to create an implementation of the [Qarma block cipher][2] in hardware.
This code was wrapped in an execution unit and integrated into [BOOM][3].
